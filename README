Boot to Qt manifests
====================

This repository provides manifests for Boot to Qt yocto builds

How to use this layer
---------------------

Using this layer requires Google's repo tool to be installed, you can install it
from package manager:

    sudo apt install repo

or download with:

    curl https://storage.googleapis.com/git-repo-downloads/repo -o repo
    chmod a+x repo

The meta-renesas layer needs to be populated with proprietary drivers in order
to build the images. Instructions how to do this can be found from:
https://github.com/renesas-rcar/meta-renesas/blob/warrior-Yocto-v3.19.0/meta-rcar-gen3/README.evaproprietary.md

Users inside The Qt Company network can run the initialization with additional
argument '--groups all', which fetches additional repository containing the required
proprietary drivers.

After installing the repo tool, run following commands to initialize the build environment.

    repo init -u git://code.qt.io/yocto/boot2qt-manifest -b renesas -m <manifest>
    repo sync

    export MACHINE=<target machine>
    . ./setup-environment.sh
